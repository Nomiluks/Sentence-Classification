"Mark- This is the User error you and I discussed at around 4pm. I will see you at 7:00 am (CST) instead of 8:00 am (CST), I was able to get approval for an early time for us to meet online. I will call you as soon as I get in.  Also, we can not access the Medical & Surgical Histories components. Users can access the components but can not save and accept them in to a Note. The first error is the Surgical Histories that was reported to me, I duplicated the error. Example patient # P-5156. The Master List will not pull any data into the Surgical History. I tried from the back end Admin Settings and saved a couple of data entries in Surgery. Doing this did not make any difference trying to access the Master List. I tried to access Histories > Surgeries through Clinical Overview to enter the data and then pull it in to the Note. This does not solve the problem either.  And, the same for Medical Histories. We can access the Masterlist, but we can not save and pull the data into the Note. I tried troubleshooting the problem the same as the surgery histories.

Problem/Complaints component was documented, after SAVE & ACCEPT was selected the component would not pull into the Note. I deleted the Note, therefore it deleted the associate components for that DOS. So, I re-entered the data with Marvel and this time the Note successfully loaded each component. This is an issue with some other patient charts as well, maybe not particularly the same component but with various other components.##Bug"

"Please refer to the client email below: ------------------------------------------------ As a follow-up to the conversation you and I had concerning the sort order of claims, I'd like to add the following: We generally do a reconciliation of Incomplete plus Clean claims against the Claims Summary Report. The sum of claims for Incomplete + Clean should equal the total on the summary. Frequently it doesn't, and usually it's because of a plan issue but it's impossible for us to tell wht the reason is. We urgently need a method which allows us to zero in on the reason for any discrepancy. Thus, for claims with DOS between 11/01/2006 and 11/30/2006, we have a Claims Summary total of 1101 records. Incomplete totals for that month are 12 while Clean claims total is 1083 for an aggregate of 1095. We are unable to determine where the difference of six claims is (1101 minus 1095). We need assistance on how to identify the reasons for the discrepancy. What should we be looking at and how do we do the analysis? I need a reply urgently for this period. We face the same problem for claims for the months of October and December. We have tried exporting the various Crystal reports to Excel and matching plans but that is unreliable, especially since the subtotals get in the way and different parts of the report have different formats and layouts. Please advise. Thank you. Abe Wachsman##Bug"

"As highlighted below, Dr Fowler along with many other clients have started complaining about frequent log-offs from the application. Practices also complain of freezing of the application while working. Unfortunately this is not a reproducible glitch but surely occurs on a regular basis. The reason we at client support are convinced that this is an on going issue is the fact that many clients every now and then complain of such frequent log-offs and freezing. Further more we get frequently logged out while working on time consuming projects such as creation of provider note templates, or edits in ROS or physical exam, super bill is another hot bed of for experiencing consistent log off and loss of unsaved data. Per my observation these complaints are more frequent amongst ASP clients compared to Support ones. We need to look into this problem very seriously and try to find a fix on war footings in order to reduce frustration experienced among the end users [Clients] as this can result into stigma of ill repute about the CureMD Corporation.##Research"

"During today?s analysis meeting Between Aymen, Adnan, Ray & Kashif the following modifications have been recommended/Discussed; 1. Examination should be diagnosis based. 2. Association of assessment & plan with diagnosis. 3. There should be custom built templates for three standard types of procedures performed at a dermatology practice. Examination should be diagnosis based: ? In this modification the physical exam should be associated with the diagnosis and should populate in accordance to the value of the diagnosis selected. ? Kashif?s recommendation on this request is to open a pop of physical exam once a diagnosis is selected, so the user should be able to select the required values of PE and save them against the selected diagnosis. Association of assessment & plan with diagnosis: ? The request is an effort to make all the values of assessment & plan appear as the part of the diagnosis component. ? Kashif?s suggestion on this request is to let the values of assessment & plan appear under the header of a diagnosis in a provider note. ? Another recommendation by Aymen is to work with the order sets for achieving this goal. Custom built templates for three standard types of procedures performed at a dermatology practice: ? For commonly used standard procedures we intend to use custom forms. ? For complex procedures with lot of details we should create templates from scratch. ? For Mohs surgery/removal the standard template from Sapien should be used as there is only one standard template for this procedure. ?

In Date and Scheduled Date: Please notice that the Check ? In date is same as the date for which the appointment is scheduled. The appointment is not checked ? in yet so the system should not pull in appointment date. Rather it should leave the Check ? In Date field blank. It causes confusion for the user. 2. Problem with Tabbing: I enter the code manually. Ideally, the Total Charges field should auto ? populate since there are values added in the fee schedules for this location already. But you can see the above 2 field rows are not auto - populated. However, when I use the ?HCPCS/Rates? button to search for and select the code, it auto ? populates, pulling the Total Charges amount (2700) from the fee schedule set up for this location. 3. Lost ?Total Charges? Values: Click inside any of Revenue Code, Start Date, end Date, Modifier, Service Unit or Total Charges field. Most likely, the ?Total Charges? amount pulled from fee schedule vanishes! 4. Inconsistent Date Format: Notice that dates do not look similar in format.

"Issue: The client tried printing a report for patient payments on 10/27/2011 but the total amount of intakes did not match the total on the report.

You can generate the report using the following workflow: Reports > Patient > Payments > Select Payment Date 10/27/2011 I did some research and found out that the patient Patricia Wyckoff?s transaction amount was not reconciling with the report data. Even though she paid in a check for $ 160.00, the amount received shows up as $ 60.00. In the screen shot below you will also be able to see an Unapplied Advance amount of $ 110.00. Then I checked the payment details for Patricia Wyckoff (Acc# 7462) individually. For this you can follow the following work flow: Reports > Patient > Payments > Put in Acc# 7462 and select Payment date 10/27/2011 The following report would come up. Please look closely as the amount received is still $ 60.00 instead of $ 160.00. Secondly the Unapplied funds is $ 0.00 which is $ 110.00 in the payments report for all patients on 10/27/2011.

In order to have the permissions updated actually, you need to go to every user?s profile whose role is set to ?Physician?, change the role to a role other than physician, and switch it back to ?Physician? and save it. This causes hassle when we have to update rights for a practice with a large number of users. We have lived with this issue for a long time now but this has recently caused a problem at Clinilabs.

I did send those claims back out on February 20th according to my note, since the notification from the system came in that they were old. Those claims did have the box checked off to Dr. Wilson as the Billing Provider, so I am not sure how they got to Medicare as the PA/Mid Level as the billing provider.

"Background: Client had reported an issue where the History modules were showing an extra space after the last value selected within the component. For example, the Medical History module (see Screen 1 below). I?ve only used the sample of the Medical History module but this issue was recurring for the Social History, Surgery History and Family History modules as well. The attached email shows these other modules. Negative Impact #1: The presence of these extra spaces in the clinical workflow was creating a problem when a note was created with these components. The note itself would show an extra space in the affected components. Negative Impact #2: The HTML preview of this provider note would also contain the extra space and thus lengthen the size of the note. Current Status: It seems that the issue is partially fixed. If we add Clinical History from scratch for a patient, then there is no extra spacing. However, if we try to edit the Clinical History of the old patient encounters (from the Clinical Workflow), then the extra space still exists. This creates a problem because the HTML preview of the note still contains the extra space. If a provider imports a note created that had this problem, this problem will persist in the HTML Preview. Request: Reehan\Can we run a script to remove the extra spacing for all patient history modules added prior to 04/25/2012? The correction should be reflected in the clinical workflow. I believe that if the Clinical Workflow is corrected, this will carry over into the HTML preview. <<<<----------see CLOSED ACTIVITIES for initial email to QA---------------##Research"

"There is an issue that appeared with our favorite client, Eastern Suffolk Cardiology. I?m sure you?ll recall that we had done some extensive payments work for them, especially helping them catch up with Medicare payments. One of the secondary payers, First United American, has rejected a lot of their secondary claims because the Medicare Claim Control number (ICN) number was missing in the EDI file. Adeel and I had corrected the ERA payments to pull the ICN number from the primary ERA. However, the manual postings that we had done last year for the Medicare EOBs do not have the ICN number. The reason it didn?t is because Development had recently delivered the ICN number field on the payments page (as of early January 2012). So, in fact, this field was not even available when we did the postings for them last year. What can we do about this issue? The issue seems to be isolated to only this payer, First United American. How can we help them resubmit these claims. These claims had been resubmitted multiple times, so their appeals are well within timely filing limits.##Research"

"The above client has recently made a change in their business requirements. They are requesting that the billing Pay-To Address be changed to: 45 Research Way Suite 204 East Setauket, New York 11733-6401 The billing address is no longer the standard appointment location but the above Pay-To address. All claims must now contain the above address in Box 33 (for paper claims) and the appropriate loop (for EDI claims). Issue Details: I?ve changed the Pay-To address in each provider?s profile, however, upon testing a dummy patient, the claim still contained the appointment location address. This client bills as a group and has over 4000+ billing groups for all payers across all locations. On a hunch, I decided to change the Billing Address for one of the billing groups. (Payer: MEDICARE; Location: Riverhead) Shahid\I?d appreciate if you can verify a few things. Point # 3 is the actual requested change. 1. If we add the new address in the Pay-To section of the billing group profile, can you confirm if this address will go in the correct loop to the payer? 2. Instead of adding the new address in the Pay-To section, can we just update the Billing Address section. Will this work also? a. Would there be any problems if we maintained the original billing address & changed the Pay-To section only? 3. I changed the address for one billing group and I selected ?Save for All Plans? and it didn?t work. Please ensure that all 4060 billing groups are updated with the new address. Adeel\I?d appreciate if you can look into the following: 4. If I use the Pay-To address section only in the billing group profile, none of the HCFA templates update with the new address.It seems that Box 33 of the HCFA forms are designed to only retrieve information from the Billing Address section and not from the Pay-To address section.

"Hi Reehan, West 11 Peds have reported this issues last week, we fixed PART of it, but now its not working again. We have 8 growth charts in the application, all of them are showing inaccurate information. The doctor is really upset about it.  First GC weight for age percentiles, was reported and fixed earlier this week, but now you if you check it, its not giving us the right information on the chart, so here are the problems. Issue 1: if you have 3 vitals on a patient only 2 will show up, so in the case of 6 vitals only 5 will show up. So on GCs first vital recorded will not appear on the chart. This was fixed but its happening again now. Issue 2: The weight record on the vitals are showing incorrect data on the GCs, as I reported previously, if the patient?s last recorded weight is 10.04 the GC shows 9.98. which reflects really bad on our software. Issue 3: These two issues are happening on each and every single growth chart. Issue 4: Head circumference GC should have separate base values for Boys and Girls. The BASE values are for boys and they come up for girls too. Which is wrong. Issue 5: On the chart, we have 0 to 36 months, these values should be on monthly basis, e.g 1,2,3,?.rather than 0.5, 1.5, 2.5. Could you please fix this on priority as the doctor is really upset.##Bug"

"Client is complaining that when they inactivate an allergy, diagnosis and medication, the inactive components still show up in the note. Settings for including inactive components are not checked, therefore this information should not be showing in the note, however it does. This was originally reported as a bug and was reported as not being a problem due to the following: The components are being opened/updated manually in note from the component flag (which is not auto-population) that is why inactive components can be associated with note. As shown in the snapshot below Provider Note is created prior to the components creation. So the user created note and then manually attached (Save and Accept) the inactive/past components with note. However, the problem then arises that these inactive components are checked automatically and inorder to ensure that they do not come into the note, the user will then have to take the extra step of selecting the inactive tab and unchecking them. The inactive allergies, medications and diagnoses should not be automatically checked once they are inactived or moved to past.

This is very critical and we don?t know how many charges are not yet submitted. See below account charge created through bulk but it could not find in clean claims list. The reason behind is that our system does not pick up the charge amount after saving the claims through bulk.

Acc# 14452 DOS 03/18/2013 1) I want this issue to be resolved on all other client on urgent bases 2) Identify these problematic issue and let me know how much we missed/ or could not submit due to this reason.

"This client is having an issue with printing labels from laptop / tablet computers that use the client?s wireless service. Adeel Sb, I think we need to have someone from DC Systems to also take a look to resolve this issue. 1. The client has a ?wired? network in the office on which the label printers are available to all computers in the practice. A user can select any of these label printers from within the Patient?s Chart. This new functionality was added so the default printer on the machine does not have to be the label printer. 2. For computers on the ?wireless? network, the default printer on the machine has to be set to the label printer in order for users to print labels to a label printer. Otherwise, the labels always print on the document printer. 3. Initially, I assumed this would be because the ?wireless? computers are not using the same network as the ?wired? computers. As a result, the tablets / laptops are not recognizing the label printers on the network. The client?s IT staff states that their ?wireless? network is a subnet of their ?wired? network which has all the label printers. Ultimately, the tablets / laptops are only printing to their default printer instead of recognizing that the user selected a label printer on the network.

I spent half-an-hour aligning a HCFA for Mahjabeen Islam, only to be informed by the client that there was no change in the HCFA form they were printing.

The last two times, Mohammad Nazim handled the cases and if he will handle this one again, let me repeat, I NEED TO KNOW HOW THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.

"There seems to be somewhat of a major issue with the two following areas of Bladen County's application. FYI: this client has Windows XP with IE 8. 1. Demographics - Whenever the practice makes a change to the patient's profile screen in the chart, the changes do not get saved. Instead, it reverts to whatever was there before. For example, if you change the ""North"" to ""N"" on pt #1054's chart it and save, it will still show ""North."" Also when you click the ""Zip"" option, nothing happens. 2. Charges - when the practice tries to add a charge from the patients chart, the system freezes. When they create a quick charge and try to pull in the fee schedule, nothing comes in (none of the program codes appear and the actual fee does not populate). When you open an already created charge by DOS, nothing shows on the charge entry screen. The biggest issue here, is that this is occurring over Bladen's network only! At the office, none of these issues appear. Jared brought his laptop to the practice and was still getting these issues while he was connected to the network (his computer is Windows 8 and has IE 10). However, when he created a wifi hotspot on his phone and tried over that, he WAS able to do all of these things properly. We are wondering whether or not this is an issue with the IP Address.##Bug"

This is what I noticed in the patients where the notes were not in an OB case. I looked, and sure enough the note was in the gyn case. My MA is very meticulous and I told her that the note was in the gyn case and she very specifically told me that she had opened it in an OB case. I just assumed that she made a mistake. Second patient comes and the same thing happens. I went to her to say that she did it again, and she said she took pictures of the screen to prove that she had opened the note in the OB case. They are attached, and sure enough, she opened the note in an OB case but the note was moved to the open gyn case. I have no idea how this could happen, but it is some weird bug. Can we try to investigate this tomorrow. It was not happening to other MAs today or yesterday that we know of.

These totals are again different from the totals on the Financial Overview report which is in Reports module under Health Department section. Please see attached. Also, the totals should match each other. I understand that the A/R aging on Financial Overview module goes upto 90+ only whereas it goes upto 365+ on the report in the Reports module. But the totals should still match because 90+ is the last aging category on Financial Overview module, it should include every A/R starting from 90+ to infinity. Having said that, it should include the 365+ A/R too. So the grand totals of the three screenshots which I have attached should always match.##Research"

"Client's Description: ""This has been reported previously several times and has been fixed only to recur. This happens about once a month and has to be fixed, why can't it STAY FIXED!!! what happens is when I select my vaccines, I always start by selecting the 90460 and 90461 administration codes most often both. Then I select the vaccines themselves. When correct everything should line up in the sequence selected but when this problem goes wrong, as it has done about once per month what happens is the 90460 and 90461 get thrown to opposite ends. so I can select 4 vaccines for example and the 90460 and 90461 were next to each other, now they are at complete opposite ends separated by the 4 vaccines. Also when I sign the super bill it is worse because it is completely scramled the vaccines and admin. codes are totally randomly interspersed in any order. Why does this matter? Because it makes it harder for the billers and for me to bill correctly in this environment."" This has been reported previously too. Kindly provide a permanent fix. Thank you.##Research"

"After a lengthy discussion the client still states that insurance addresses and phone number have been changed.

The client enters insurance plan information from what is listed on the insurance card only. If you look at the Cigna insurance card photo the address is , 100 Great West Drive, Kennett MO 63857 (see attachment 1) When we search Settings>billing>plan>cigna> I cannot find the 1000 Great West Drive address.

This is a perfect example that proves that some of clients insurance information (addresses and phone numbers) have been changed or overwritten.

"When a practice sets up appointment confirmations, patients receive an email message giving them three options [confirm appointment; cancel appointment; reschedule appointment]. The patient can click on any one of these options from their email message. This request comes into the Personal ? Administration ? Appointment Confirmation bucket and needs to be processed by the staff in order to update the provider?s calendar. There is a shortcut to this bucket in the ?Quick Links? section of the ?My Preferences? page. However, it doesn?t seem to be available for the above client. I?ve investigated this in other DBs and it seems like that the Patient Portal has to be activated in order for this Appointment Confirmation shortcut can appear for the Quick Links section. This is very odd because appointment confirmations have nothing to do with the Patient Portal. It is entirely possible that practices can use the ?Appointment Confirmations? feature and not use the Patient Portal. It seems odd that DC has tied the Patient Portal to the Appointment Confirmations shortcut.##Research"

Hence to add 81.0 into the system we have to add it as 081.0 which is wrong since 81.0 and 081.0 are two different diagnosis. The same thing applies for all the 2 number codes, they cannot and should not be added as 3 number codes by putting a 0 in front of them.
